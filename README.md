# [OpenRefactory]/C \(Sublime Text 3 plugin)

## About

Refactoring is hard and can be one of the reasons that users gravitate towards
using IDEs. OpenRefactory makes error-free refactoring easy for the C
programmer, all within the confines of terminal vim or gVim.

## Install Guide

__The Easy Way:__

Note: Command Palette = `cmd+shift+p` or `Tools -> Command Palette` or `ctrl+shift+`

* Install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)
* Command Palette -> Add Repository -> `https://github.com/rdallman/openrefactory_subl`
* Command Palette -> Install Package -> openrefactory_subl

__The Hard Way (for internal use w/ repo):__

Note: $PACKAGEDIR isn't a thing. To find your $PACKAGEDIR, open sublime text and command palette -> browse packages

E.g. mac: $PACKAGEDIR = $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages

let $OPENREFACTORY_SUBL = /PATH/TO/OpenRefactory/org.openrefactory.ui.sublimetext

* `ant -f $OPENREFACTORY_SUBL/build.xml`
* `ln -s $OPENREFACTORY_SUBL/openrefactory_subl $PACKAGEDIR/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/openrefactory_subl`

## Quick Start
for the below, open your command palette (command+shift+p) and type this in (kind of in order...) to complete a transformation 

* OpenRefactory: Refactor -> type desired xform
* OpenRefactory: View Log (if it exists...)
* OpenRefactory: View Files (if you want...)
* OpenRefactory: Execute Transformation
